\title{Cavitation resistance for Callitris branches}
\format{A data frame with 31 rows and 3 variables:
\describe{
  \item{\code{Rep}}{integer Replicate - four branches are included.}
  \item{\code{Psi}}{double Positive-valued negative xylem water pressure (MPa)}
  \item{\code{PLC}}{double Percent loss conductivity (sometimes < 0)}
}}
\usage{
callitrishydraulic
}
\description{
Measurements of so-called 'percent loss conductivity' (PLC) curves on terminal
twigs of Callitris trees (a member of the Cupressaceae in Australia). Twigs are subjected to
increasingly negative xylem pressure (Psi, included as a positive pressure in MPa), and the loss
in conductivity (i.e. the conductivity of water transport in the xylem) is measured.
