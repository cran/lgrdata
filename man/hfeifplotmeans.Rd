\format{A data frame with 320 rows and 5 variables:
\describe{
  \item{\code{plotnr}}{integer A total of sixteen plots (four treatments).}
  \item{\code{Date}}{factor The date of measurement (YYYY-MM-DD)}
  \item{\code{diameter}}{double Mean diameter for the sample trees ($cm$).}
  \item{\code{height}}{double Mean height for the sample trees ($m$).}
  \item{\code{treat}}{integer One of four treatments (I - irrigated, F - dry fertilized, IL - Liquid fertilizer plus irrigation, C - control)}
}}

\description{
Heights and stem diameters of trees growing in a fertilization x irrigation experiment in
Richmond, New South Wales, Australia, as part pf the Hawkesbury Forest Experiment (HFE).
A total of 16 plots, each with 72 Eucalyptus saligna trees, was remeasured 17 times between
2008 and 2012. Treatments to the plots were either control (C), applied with fertilizer (F),
irrigation (I), or irrigation+fertilization (IF).

This dataset contains the plot-level means, see \code{\link{hfeifbytree}} for tree-level
measurements.
