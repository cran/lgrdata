\format{A data frame with 249 rows and 7 variables:
\describe{

  \item{\code{species}}{integer Pinus ponderosa or Pinus monticola}
  \item{\code{dfromtop}}{double Distance from top of tree (where leaf sample was taken) (m)}
  \item{\code{totheight}}{double Total height of the tree (m)}
  \item{\code{height}}{double Height from the ground (where sample was taken) (m)}
  \item{\code{LMA}}{double Leaf mass per area (g m$^{-2}$)}
  \item{\code{narea}}{double Nitrogen per area (gN m$^{-2}$)}

\usage{
treecanopy
}
\description{
Leaves of two pine species (35 trees in total) were sampled throughout their canopy, usually 8 samples were
taken at various heights. The height is expressed as the 'distance from top', i.e. the distance to the
apex of the tree. Leaves (conifer needles) were analysed for nitrogen content (narea), and an index
of leaf thickness, the 'leaf mass per area'. The data show the usual pattern of higher leaf thickness
(higher LMA) toward the top of the trees, but individual trees show a lot of variation in LMA.
