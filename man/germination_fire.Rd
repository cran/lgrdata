\description{
Two datasets on the germination success of seeds of four \emph{Melaleuca}
species, when subjected to temperature, fire cue, and dehydration treatments. Seeds were
collected from a number of sites and subjected to 6 temperature treatments and fire cues
(in the fire germination data), or two a range of dehydration levels (in the water germination
data).

This dataset contains the fire treatment data.
