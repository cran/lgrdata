\title{Choat's Plant Drought Tolerance}
\format{A data frame with 115 rows and 2 variables:
\describe{
  \item{\code{annualprecip}}{integer Annual rainfall (mm) where the plant was sampled.}
  \item{\code{P50}}{double The negative water pressure in the xylem at which 50\% of stem
  conductivity is lost. More negative indicates higher tolerance to drought.}

\description{
Data include a measure of plant drought tolerance (P50, more negative values
indicate plant stems can tolerate lower water contents), and mean annual precipitation of the
location where the sample was taken. Data are for 115 individual species (species name not
included). Data are from original source were simplified for the purpose of this book.
