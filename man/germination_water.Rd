\title{Seed germination as affected by water}
\format{A data frame with 352 rows and 5 variables:
\describe{
  \item{\code{species}}{factor One of four Melaleuca species}
  \item{\code{site}}{integer Coding for the site where the seed was collected}
  \item{\code{water.potential}}{double Water potential of the seed (Mpa) after
  incubation (low values is drier)}
  \item{\code{germ}}{integer Number of germinated seeds}
  \item{\code{n}}{integer Number of seeds tested (25 for all rows)}
}}

Data are from Hewitt et al. 2015 (Austral Ecology 40(6):661-671),

\description{
Two datasets on the germination success of seeds of four \emph{Melaleuca}
species, when subjected to temperature, fire cue, and dehydration treatments. Seeds were
collected from a number of sites and subjected to 6 temperature treatments and fire cues
(in the fire germination data), or two a range of dehydration levels (in the water germination
data).

This dataset contains the water treatment data.
