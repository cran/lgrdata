\description{
This file contains estimates of plant and litter cover within the rings of the
EucFACE experiment, evaluating forest ecosystem responses to elevated CO$_2$, on two dates.
Within each ring are four plots and within each plot are four 1m by 1m subplots. Values
represent counts along a grid of 16 points within each subplot.
