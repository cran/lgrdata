\description{
A dataset on the number of words remembered from list,
for various learning techniques, and in two age groups.

Description taken from source: "Why do older people often seem not to
remember things as well as younger people? Do they not pay attention? Do they
just not process the material as thoroughly? One theory regarding memory is that
verbal material is remembered as a function of the degree to which is was processed
when it was initially presented. Eysenck (1974) randomly assigned 50 younger
subjects and 50 older (between 55 and 65 years old) to one of five learning groups.
The Counting group was asked to read through a list of words and count the number of
letters in each word. This involved the lowest level of processing. The Rhyming group
was asked to read each word and think of a word that rhymed with it. The Adjective group
was asked to give an adjective that could reasonably be used to modify each word in the
list. The Imagery group was instructed to form vivid images of each word, and this was
assumed to require the deepest level of processing. None of these four groups was told
they would later be asked to recall the items. Finally, the Intentional group was asked
to memorize the words for later recall. After the subjects had gone through the list of
27 items three times they were asked to write down all the words they could remember."
