#'   \item{\code{Process}}{factor One of five methods used to memorize the words. }
#'   \item{\code{Words}}{double Number of words recalled.}
#'}
#' @details Description taken from source: "Why do older people often seem not to
#' remember things as well as younger people? Do they not pay attention? Do they
#' just not process the material as thoroughly? One theory regarding memory is that
#' verbal material is remembered as a function of the degree to which is was processed
#' when it was initially presented. Eysenck (1974) randomly assigned 50 younger
#' subjects and 50 older (between 55 and 65 years old) to one of five learning groups.
#' The Counting group was asked to read through a list of words and count the number of
#' letters in each word. This involved the lowest level of processing. The Rhyming group
#' was asked to read each word and think of a word that rhymed with it. The Adjective group
#' was asked to give an adjective that could reasonably be used to modify each word in the
#' list. The Imagery group was instructed to form vivid images of each word, and this was
#' assumed to require the deepest level of processing. None of these four groups was told
#' they would later be asked to recall the items. Finally, the Intentional group was asked
#' to memorize the words for later recall. After the subjects had gone through the list of
#' 27 items three times they were asked to write down all the words they could remember."

#'}
#' @details Description taken from source: "Students in an introductory statistics class
#' (MS212 taught by Professor John Eccleston and Dr Richard Wilson at The University of
#' Queensland) participated in a simple experiment. The students took their own pulse rate.
#' They were then asked to flip a coin. If the coin came up heads, they were to run in place
#' for one minute. Otherwise they sat for one minute. Then everyone took their pulse again.
#' The pulse rates and other physiological and lifestyle data are given in the data.
#' Five class groups between 1993 and 1998 participated in the experiment. The lecturer,
#' Richard Wilson, was concerned that some students would choose the less strenuous option of
#' sitting rather than running even if their coin came up heads, so in the years 1995-1998 a
#' different method of random assignment was used. In these years, data forms were handed out
#' to the class before the experiment. The forms were pre-assigned to either running or non-running
#' and there were an equal number of each. In 1995 and 1998 not all of the forms were returned
#' so the numbers running and sitting was still not entirely controlled."
